In this project I made a framework to make developing easier on Game Maker Studio 2. The project included scriptable actions for buttons, switches, frames, labels and game items, easy to use GUI elements, with editable sprites and animations, example game structure to learn how things work, original soundtrack used as placeholder music, sound effects and a custom music player.
